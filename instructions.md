# Photoview instructions

## Initial setup

When you visit the site the first time you will be presented with an "Initial Setup Wizard"
that asks for a username and a pasword as well as a "Photo path".

Media from the File Browser service can be accessed at `/root/persistance/start9/public/filebrowser`.
For a quick set up you can set the "Photo path" to this path and you will have acces to all your media.
You can always change this later from the Settings

After initial setup, go to the Settings page and click on "Scan all" your media will then appear in the app as it is scanned.

## Usage
