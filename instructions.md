# Photoview instructions

## Initial setup

When you visit the site the first time you will be presented with an "Initial Setup Wizard"
that asks for a username and a password as well as a "Photo path".

Media from the File Browser service can be accessed at `/media/start9/public/filebrowser`.
This can be copied from the "Properties" section of Photoview.
For a quick set up you can set the "Photo path" to this path and you will have access to all your media.
You can always change this later from the Settings.
If you only wish to scan a subset of your filebrowser data, you can use the location above as a prefix and add any subfolders you wish.

After initial setup, go to the Settings page and click on "Scan all" your media will then appear in the app as it is scanned.

## Usage
