# Usage Instructions

1. In your Photoview Web Interface, insert your default username and password. These are located in `Properties`.
1. Bookmark the site for future visits, or better yet, save it to your Bitwarden server!
1. Navigate to the settings menu from the left sidebar and click "Scan all users". Your media will then appear in the application as it is scanned. This sync will need to be preformed whenever new media is added.
1. Optionally change your default username/password. Please note, this change **will not** be reflected in the `Properties` section mentioned above.
1. If you accidentally lock yourself out, the "Reset Root User" action will reset your username and password.
