# Photoview Instructions

## Initial Setup

1. When you visit your Photoview website the first time you will be presented with an "Initial Setup Wizard" that asks for username, password, and "Photo Path". You can find the default Photo Path inside the "Properties" section of your Photoview service. Using this default path will grant your Photoview admin user access to all media files inside File Browser. If you only wish to use a subset of your File Browser data, you can append to the default path your desired sub directory. You can always change this later inside the settings menu of your Photoview website.

2. Go to the Settings page and click on "Scan all" your media will then appear in the app as it is scanned.

## Usage
