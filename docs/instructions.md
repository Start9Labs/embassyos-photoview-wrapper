# Photoview Instructions

## Initial Setup

1. When you visit your Photoview website the first time, you will be presented with an "Initial Setup Wizard" that asks for a username, password, and "Photo Path". You can find the default "Photo Path" inside the "Properties" section of your Photoview service. Using this default path will grant your Photoview admin user access to all media files inside File Browser. 
    - If you wish to use only a subset of your File Browser data, you can append your desired sub directory to the default path, ie. `/media/start9/public/filebrowser/photos` during this setup process. This value can always be changed inside the settings menu of your Photoview website.

2. Navigate to the settings menu from the left sidebar and click "Scan all users". Your media will then appear in the application as it is scanned. This sync will need to be preformed whenever new media is added.
